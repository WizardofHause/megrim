# Megrim

### Overview
This is an exploratory Rails/React project to catalog and display user's migraine data. 

### Planned Features
During this project I plan to do a deeper exploration into the client-side, i.e. React Hooks, React-Router-Dom, and Redux. 

I also plan to integrate an external weather API, geolocation, and probably some Ruby gems.
